We pulled data `Underlying Cause of Death, 1999-2020.txt` from
https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76. We renamed it to 
`cvd_region_raw.txt`.

```{r}
region <- read.delim("../data/cvd_region_raw.txt", header = TRUE)
region <- region[region$Month.Code != '',]
colnames(region) <- tolower(colnames(region))
region <- subset(region, select = c("census.region","month.code","crude.rate","deaths","population"))
colnames(region) <- c("region","month","crude_rate","death", "population")
region
```

The `Census Region 1: ` in the `region` column is abundant, so we will remove 
them.

```{r}
region$region <- gsub("Census Region \\d+:\\s", "", region$region)
head(region)
```

The `region` is cleaned. We will export it to a new file named `cvd_region.csv`.

```{r}
write.csv(region, file = "../data/cvd_region.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
